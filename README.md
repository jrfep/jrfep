## Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

I am ***JosÃ© R. Ferrer-Paris***, Senior Lecturer at the [Centre for Ecosystem Science](https://www.unsw.edu.au/research/ecosystem), [University of New South Wales](https://www.unsw.edu.au), Sydney, Australia.

I develop methods and frameworks to inform ecosystem science and the conservation of biological diversity. My research is influencing global and national policy on conservation.

I learn and teach by sharing experiences, challenges, solutions and insights. I contribute to capacity building around the world, outreach activities and training workshops. I mentor staff and students at UNSW.

I am often busy coding and creating documents, scripts, and maps. I use R, python and shell scripts, Markdown and Quarto, and leverage popular JavaScript libraries to create useful online resources.
